### A very lightweight wrapper around osu! api.
Even more lightweight than [the original](https://github.com/Deivu/Zuikaku)

### Usage.
Refer to [`Client.js`](https://github.com/takase1121/Zuikaku/blob/master/test/Client.js) 

### This API mostly follow the parameters found in osu! api wiki with the exception of you dont need to provide the api key in every request like how it is presented on example.

You can find the wiki in [`HERE`](https://github.com/ppy/osu-api/wiki)

> Tested by `npm i --production` to a local directory and obtain its size from the properties window.
> This comparison might not represent the real module size, it is meant to give people a general impression of the size differences.

### NOTE
> This is in development but stable enough to be on production and I would add some minor features in future.
